Overview of the project.

WEATHER

This project demonstrates how to integrate a public API (OpenWeatherMap) with Python to fetch real-time weather data. It processes this data and visualizes it using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The visualizations are then compiled into a dashboard that provides an interactive and insightful look into weather trends and patterns.

Objectives

API Integration: Fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Data Processing: Clean and structure the API data for visualization.

Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create meaningful charts and graphs, such as temperature trends, humidity levels, and wind speed comparisons.

Dashboard Creation: Assemble these visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard to present the findings.

Deliverables

Python Script: A script that fetches, processes, and visualizes the data.

Visualization Dashboard: A dashboard featuring interactive and informative charts displaying weather-related insights.

Technologies Used

Python

OpenWeatherMap API

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook (if applicable)

How to Run

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git

Install the necessary dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook to view the visualizations. Results

The project provides visual insights into weather trends such as:

Temperature variations over time

Humidity and wind speed comparisons across different locations

Data patterns that help in forecasting weather-related decisions.
